The answer lies in three words: <strong>privacy, speed, and simplicity</strong>.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Privacy First</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Most online regex tools send your input strings to a server for processing. If you’re testing sensitive data—like email lists, API keys, or server logs—that’s a risk. Our tool is 100% client-side, built with SvelteKit and deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages. Your data never leaves your browser, ensuring maximum privacy.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Speed That Scales</h3> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Testing thousands of strings shouldn’t slow you down. Using native JavaScript’s <code>RegExp.test()</code> and a 300ms debounce, our tool processes 10,000 lines in under 100ms on modern hardware. Svelte’s reactivity ensures the UI updates instantly as you type, with zero lag.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Simplicity for All</h3> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Whether you’re a regex novice or a seasoned developer, our interface is intuitive. Enter your pattern, toggle flags (g, i, m, s, u, y), paste your strings, and see results in real-time. Features like “Copy Matching” and “Invert Results” make complex tasks effortless.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why It Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Developers need tools that respect their data and time. By combining privacy, performance, and a clean Bootstrap 5 design, we’ve built a regex tester that feels like an extension of your workflow. No accounts, no cookies, no tracking—just a tool that works.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Is it really 100% client-side?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Yes. All processing happens in your browser using JavaScript. No network requests are made after the initial page load.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Can it handle large datasets?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Absolutely. It’s optimized for 10,000+ lines with minimal memory usage.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">How do I report a bug?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">File an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/YourUsername/bulk-string-set-regex-tester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repo</a>.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">Built for developers, by developers.
